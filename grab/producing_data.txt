All original jpeg images were downloaded using wget -r (recursive)


Manual filtering out only the best images was performed.


shtml files corresponding to the best images were filtered out by the cull.sh script:

cd dir_with_shtml_files
./cull.sh dir_with_best_images/*.jpg


Directory 'good' that contains best shtml is created and populated.


Parse best shtml files for women, children and images data:

../data_parser good/*.shtml
../images_parser good/*.shmtl


Text files women.data, children.data and images.data containing data to be transferred
to the database are created.
