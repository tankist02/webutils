Algorithm goal: find out the best HTML entries, remove all others

1. Download all possible JPEG entries and manually select the best.
   Use: wget -r root_url.


2. From JPEG entries select the keys and store them in file keys.txt.
   Use: find . -name '??????.jpg' -execdir basename '{}' .jpg \; > keys.txt


3. Load generated unique keys into HTML parser program.
   Use: html_parser keys.txt

   The program stores the keys internally in the std::set object.


4. Supply HTML entries to the parser program.
   Use: find . -maxdepth 1 *.shtml | xargs html_parser


5. For every HTML entry extract the key it contains.

6. Check if the key is in the keys database.

7. If it is not move the HTML entry to junk.
